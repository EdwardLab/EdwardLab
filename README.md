### Welcome to Edward's GitHub

Hey there! I'm Edward, the Founder and President of the nonprofit organization DigitalPlat. I'm also a student and developer, turning my ideas into reality.

I'm passionate about creating both innovative and practical open-source projects. Additionally, I actively work on nonprofit initiatives to promote internet freedom. As a proud club leader of Hack Club, I enjoy collaborating with a global community of young hackers. I strongly support internet freedom, democracy, and human rights.

ðŸ’¡ I am currently working in software development, the Internet of Things (IoT), cybersecurity (including network maintenance), Linux and embedded development, and edge computing.

ðŸŽ“ I am currently studying operating system kernel development (OSDEV), AI and machine learning, and front-end development (React), among other things.

I manage a lot of open-source and nonprofit projects. I keep all of them updated, fix bugs, respond to emails, and address user questions. Most of these projects are maintained by me alone, so please donâ€™t rush me for updates or expect immediate replies. I'm currently in high school and living on my own, so I have a lot on my plate and stay very busy. For general inquiries or to reach out, please leave a message on my website at [https://edwarddev.com/#contact](https://edwarddev.com/#contact) or email me at hi@edwarddev.com. Iâ€™ll do my best to read and respond. Thank you for your understanding!
