### Welcome to Edward's GitHub

Hi, I'm Edward — Hi, I'm Edward — a high school student, developer, systems architect, and founder of [DigitalPlat](https://digitalplat.org), a nonprofit supporting internet freedom and open-source infrastructure for 200,000+ users globally.

I build high-impact open-source tools — from operating systems and domain infrastructure to embedded platforms and portable runtimes. I'm also a strong advocate for internet freedom, democracy, and human rights.

🌍 Currently based in Manila and living independently, I lead multiple open-source projects while studying OS kernel design, AI/ML, embedded Linux, and full-stack development.

⚙️ **Focus areas:**
- Operating systems, kernel engineering, and low-level architecture (x86/ARM)
- Containerization, virtualization, and distributed edge computing
- Portable runtimes, scripting ecosystems, and interpreter design
- DNS infrastructure, networking protocols, and secure internet services
- Embedded systems, IoT development, and applied cybersecurity

🧠 I'm also a Hack Club club leader, collaborating with young makers around the world to build things that matter.

⏳ I personally maintain all my projects — fixing bugs, shipping updates, answering questions — while balancing school and life. If I’m slow to reply, thanks for your patience.
